## Introduction

BalancedView was initiated by Quentin Meeus and Calum Thornhill in the fall of 2018. Fake news was a hot topic and spread faster and futher on the web than cholera in a glass of water. Of course, the manipulation of information is not something new and is mastered by dictatorial regimes and shady political persons for ages. What makes it more of a problem now than at any other time in History then? Well in this Internet age, the amount of information that each of us is exposed to each day is staggering, whether it comes from news media, blogs, forums, Facebook, Instagram or Google. Anyone can share anything without control whatsoever. Obviously, this has advantages in terms of freedom of speech, but it also means that it is much more complicated to verify each piece of information.

Some social networks and NGO's started to look into the problem, trying to detect false information as it is published or shared. Generally, the approach taken requires experts and journalists to fact check each piece of information manually and flag news articles as "fake" by the means of a sticker. In the literature, this is what is called a nudge by information. The idea is to control the spreading of incorrect information by letting the user know that a given article probably contains dubious or incorrect statements. The approach chosen in BalancedView is more of an educational one, where the user is encouraged to research and assess by himself the quality of articles found online. This is referred to as a nudge by presentation. This choice is motivated by the so-called "confirmation bias" effect, according to which one accepts more easily arguments aligned with one's beliefs rather than arguments that contradicts them. Further, we think that it is imperative that people start to question everything that is read online and learn how not to fall into passively absorbing information without verifying its validity.

The remaining of this document is divided into 3 sections: first a brief overview of the tool, second a word about the design choices and finally some technical details.

## Overview

Rather than creating a machine learning algorithm to detect when an article contains statements that are incorrect, the chosen approach is educational:
